<h1>How to make it ?</h1>

<p>Really? A recipe for fruit salad?
<p>Yes, you need it.<P>
Because this simple dressing takes strawberries,
raspberries, and mangoes to a whole new level.<P>
Sweet syrupy honey, fresh tart orange juice,<P>
nd bright lemon zest come together to elevate
your fruit (even if they're out of season) to new heights.</p>

<h2>Can I use frozen fruit?</h2>

<p>We like to be the cool parent here at Delish and never want to say no...<p>
<p>But in this case, you can't use frozen fruit!<p>
<p>Because fruits are mostly water, their cell structures change<p>
<p>When frozen: when water turns to ice,<p>
<p>It expands as its cells rearrange themselves into a tight crystalline formation.<p>
<p>When you bring frozen fruit to room temperature,<P>
<p>You may notice that a lot of the fruit looks very deflated<p>
<p>And mushy—and that's because that crystalline arrangement during freezing punctured through<p>
<p>The cell walls of the fruit, causing their collapse once defrosted.<p>
So unless you like mushy fruit salad that borders on fruit soup...

</p>

<h3>Can I prepare the salad ahead of time?</h3>

<p>You can, but hold off on dressing it until right before serving<p>
<p>And keep your prepared and cut fruits well covered and refrigerated until it's time to serve.<p>
<p>We recommend prepping the fruit within 4 hours of serving—any longer<p>
<p>And you'll start to see shrivelling and oxidation on the cut fruit.<p>
<p>If you want to prevent your chopped apples from browning too much,<p>
<p>Toss them with a tablespoon of lemon juice and put them on the bottom of the fruit bowl<p></p>
<p>To reduce their contact with air.</p>
